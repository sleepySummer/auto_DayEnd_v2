## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/sleepySummer/auto_DayEnd.git
   cd auto_DayEnd
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage

1. **Set Up Configuration:**
   - Create a seperated `config.py` file in the project directory with your individual login credentials:
     ```python
     # config.py
     itrade_username = "your_username"
     itrade_password = "your_password"
     mysql_password = "your_password"
     ```

2. **Run the Script:**
   - Execute the main script, or scheduler, to start the process:
     ```sh
     python main_cmd.py
     ```


## Configuration

- **config.py:** This file contains the login credentials required to access the trading website. Ensure this file is in the same directory as `main_cmd.py` and is not included in version control for security reasons.

- **cerror_log_config.py:** Initializes error logging to error_log.txt.
