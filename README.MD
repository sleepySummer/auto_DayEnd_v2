# ⚙️ Automated Trading ETL Pipeline

This project implements a robust **ETL pipeline** for automating the extraction, transformation, and loading of trading data from a secure financial platform. It is designed to run on a scheduled basis, clean and enrich the data, update a MySQL database, and generate structured deal commands for downstream use.

## 📊 Overview

This ETL pipeline automates:

- **Extraction**: Logging into a trading platform and downloading multiple CSV reports.
- **Transformation**: Cleaning, enriching, and merging data using Pandas and Excel macros.
- **Loading**: Updating a MySQL database and generating structured deal commands.

It is designed for daily execution and supports seasonal scheduling (Summer/Winter).

---

## 🚀 Features

- Scheduled execution via Python's `schedule` module.
- Automated login and data download using `twill`.
- Data cleaning and augmentation with Pandas.
- Excel macro refresh and extraction using `win32com`.
- MySQL integration for deal tracking.
- Structured deal command generation.
- Centralized error logging.

## 🛠️ Installation
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/sleepySummer/auto_DayEnd.git
   cd auto_DayEnd
   ```
2. **Install dependencies:**
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage

1. **Set Up Configuration:**
   - Create a seperated `config.py` file in the project directory with your individual login credentials:
     ```python
     # config.py
     itrade_username = "your_username"
     itrade_password = "your_password"
     mysql_password = "your_password"
     ```

2. **Run the Script:**
   - Execute the main script, or scheduler, to start the process:
     ```sh
     python main_cmd.py
     ```


## Configuration

- **config.py:** This file contains the login credentials required to access the trading website. Ensure this file is in the same directory as `main_cmd.py` and is not included in version control for security reasons.

- **cerror_log_config.py:** Initializes error logging to error_log.txt.

## Modules

### main_cmd.py – Scheduler
- Launches cmd_app.py at scheduled times based on season.

### cmd_app.py – Extract
- Logs into the trading site.
- Downloads multiple CSV reports.
- Initiates transformation and loading steps.

### edit_csv.py – Transform
- Cleans raw data and appends test deals to DealList.

### fxdr_to_csv.py – Transform
- Refreshes and loads data from FXDR_v5.xlsm.
- Cleans and exports to current_deal.csv.

### fxdr_to_sql_v2.py – Load
- Inserts or updates deal records in MySQL.
- Triggers deal command generation.

### deal_status.py – Transform & Output
- Generates structured deal commands (OpenMarket, Rollover, CloseMarket).
- Saves output to new_testdeal.csv.

### error_log_config.py – Logging
- Configures centralized error logging.
